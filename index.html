                                Early focus on users and tasks: The design of the product should be centered on the end-user as they will be the
                                consumer. The scope, functionality and complexity of the product should always be envisioned with how enjoyable it will
                                be for the user. They need to be part of the design team (at least indirectly) through interviews and tests.

                                Empirical measurement: When the user is testing something related to your product, you need to pay attention to their
                                reactions and comments (especially those that come out naturally) as they will give you the most honest feedback. This
                                measurements are then later used for corrections.

                                Iterative Design: By combining the user feedback, you should be constantly correcting your design. After that, you make
                                a prototype again and get it tested. This is repeated as much as it is needed until the product reaches the specified
                                requirements for release (and even beyond this step).

                                (Interviewed Oct 9 , 2018) *He gave us a very different perspective on the solution of traffic.
                                Instead of making an effort to expand streets or fast lanes for cars (as they stop working eventually),
                                he says that bike lanes are the ones that need to be improved, as they can be faster and healthier than cars.
                                Culture needs to be changed so people realize that bikes and walking are actually viable in most of our daily trips.
